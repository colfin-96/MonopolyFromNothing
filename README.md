##General questions

1. Are we going to enable various Monopoly rules or just choose one?
    * Paul -> Just choose one. The rest will be easily implemented once have completed the base game.
2. How are we going to do the graphics?
    * Paul -> For now output through the console, later use windows forms or an imported graphics library
3. Who's gonna do what?
    * Paul -> Good question, we need to make a list of the different components people could work on separately and how they merge together.

##To dos
Dice: Would it be a good idea to make 2 random nums? It gives the advantage of being able to tell whether a double has been thrown
Yea. Write a property/method that returns a bool if dice1 == dice2
