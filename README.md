**General questions**

1) Are we going to enable various Monopoly rules or just choose one?

Paul- Just choose one. The rest will be easily implemented once have completed the base game.

2) How are we going to do the graphics?

Paul- For now output through the console, later use windows forms or an imported graphics library

3) Who's gonna do what?

Paul- Good question, we need to make a list of the different components people could work on separately and how they merge together.

Dice: Would it be a good idea to make 2 random nums? It gives the advantage of being able to tell whether a double has been thrown
Yea. Write a property/method that returns a bool if dice1 == dice2
